About the Project

This project is a front-end recreation of the Spotify web interface with a responsive sidebar navigation menu. It was built purely using HTML and CSS as part of my learning journey to strengthen my skills in UI design and responsive layouts.

The goal was to practice:
		Structuring clean and semantic HTML
		Creating visually appealing layouts using CSS
		Implementing a responsive sidebar menu with hover effects
		Understanding spacing, alignment, and typography in design
